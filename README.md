## Introduction

Tenzies is a unique dice racing game where you can freeze the dice by clicking the ones that have the same values and roll the remaining until all the dice show the same face. This project serves as an excellent playground to practice core React features, including useState and useEffect hooks, conditional rendering, and local storage. Additionally, it showcases CSS Grid usage for styling the pips of the dice.

The project's uniqueness extends to its user interface, which features custom CSS styling, Game Stats tracking, and interaction with LocalStorage for storing player name and score.
